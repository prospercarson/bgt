 · The Real Way to Make a Minecraft Hacked Client EDIT: You call the tick() method of your main class from GuiIngame's method renderIngameOverlay(), or something similar. (Almost) Every single tutorial you come across on the internet about how to make a hacked client wants you to edit the base classes of Minecraft.  · 1. Download MCP, Minecraft Coder Pack (update for not finished yet) 2. Learn Java Basics, 3. Find tutorials on using MCP. OR 1. Find a hacking client base you would like to use. 2. Edit it from there. I have created a hacking client myself for my griefing team. If you need any help, PM me and i'll walk you through it with Java, MCP, and all that jazz. So i want to create a minecraft hacked client for bedrock edition i have a some experience in C++ and i know C# how can i do it i know cheat engine and stuff but is there a library or anything i can use to make this hacked client ofc i dont want to just create horion or something but i want to just gain some experience in minecraft bedrock hacking again bedrock not java i just want .
